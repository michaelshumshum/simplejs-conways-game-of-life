## what

more frontend practice with javascript. this one really pushes javascript to it's limits. i used grids instead of a canvas, which is what makes this quite slow on bigger boards.

cells that populate will wrap on the sides, but on the top and bottom. i am too lazy to implement an accurate wrapping or remove the unintended wrapping.
